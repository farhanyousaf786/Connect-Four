# Connect Four

Connect Four is a two-player strategy game played on a 7-column by 7-row board. Each player has a color and drops succesively a circle of his color in one column, the circle falls down to the lowest empty cell of the column. The first player to make an alignment of four discs of his color wins, if the board is filled without alignment itâ€™s a draw game.
